# universal-router-sdk
This SDK facilitates interactions with Universal Router. This repo is the cometswap variation of the original Universal-router-sdk by UniswapLabs. The CometSwap implementation makes the necessary changes in order to be compatible with the Cometswap smart-router and other existing SDK's.

## Usage
Install latest version of universal-router-sdk. Then import the corresponding Trade class and Data object for each protocol you'd like to interact with.

```sh
npm add @cometswap/universal-router-sdk
# or
yarn add @cometswap/universal-router-sdk
# or
pnpm add @cometswap/universal-router-sdk
```
